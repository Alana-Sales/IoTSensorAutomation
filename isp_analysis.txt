**Observation:**
In the traceroute to `www.afrinic.net`, hop 7 is:
afrinic-ix.jhb.isp.net [196.216.2.1]

**Question:** Is `level3.net` the same ISP as hops 2–6, or is hop 7 a different ISP?

**Analysis Using `whois`:**
$ whois 196.216.2.1

inetnum:        196.216.2.0 - 196.216.2.255

country:        MU (Mauritius)

**Conclusion:**
- The IP at hop 7 belongs to **AFRINIC**, not **Level3.net**.
- Therefore, hop 7 represents a different ISP (the destination network).
- Hops 2–6 (Level3.net) serve as the transit ISP delivering packets from the source to AFRINIC.
